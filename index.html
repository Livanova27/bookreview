<p>Homestuck is a webcomic written, illustrated, and animated by American author and artist Andrew Hussie. 
The fourth overall webcomic published on Hussie's MS Paint Adventures website, it originally ran from April 13, 2009 
to April 13, 2016. The comic centers on a group of teens who unwittingly bring about the end of the world through 
the installation of a beta copy of an upcoming computer game. They soon come into contact with a group of Internet
 trolls who are revealed to be horned aliens who previously played, and these trolls work with the kids to create
 a new universe by completing the game.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestuck">Source</a> </p>
